# Module 01 - Multiple Choice Quiz Answers

## Based on completed notebooks and testing

---

### Question 1: Which Python module helps you to easily access an API?
**Answer: Requests**

**Explanation:**
- The `requests` module is specifically designed for making HTTP requests in Python
- It's used extensively in the Jobs_API notebook: `import requests`
- Simple syntax: `response = requests.get(url)`
- NumPy is for numerical computing, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting

---

### Question 2: Which of the following URL formats would you use to retrieve the JSON representation of a job listing?
**Answer: /positions.json**

**Explanation:**
- JSON files have the `.json` extension
- RESTful APIs typically use file extensions or content-type headers to specify format
- `.csv` = CSV format
- `.html` = HTML format
- `.xml` = XML format

---

### Question 3: What step should you take after downloading the Jobs_API file to run it in IBM Watson Studio?
**Answer: Upload the file to IBM Watson Studio**

**Explanation:**
- The Jobs_API.ipynb file needs to be uploaded to the Watson Studio environment
- Once uploaded, you can open and run all cells
- The file doesn't need conversion (it's already .ipynb format)
- No compilation needed (Python is interpreted)

### Question 4: You are building a web scraping tool in Python and need to retrieve data from a web page. Which module will you use to download a web page in Python?
**Answer: requests**

**Explanation:**
- Used in our Web Scraping Lab: `data = requests.get(url).text`
- `requests` is the modern, user-friendly HTTP library
- `urllib` also works but is older and less convenient
- `bs4` (BeautifulSoup) is for parsing HTML, not downloading
- `json` is for JSON processing

---

### Question 5: Which function in the csv module allows you to write rows into a CSV file?
**Answer: writerow**

**Explanation:**
- From our Web Scraping Lab: `writer.writerow([languages[i], salaries[i]])`
- `writerow()` writes a single row to the CSV file
- Usage: `csv.writer(file).writerow(['col1', 'col2'])`
- Other options don't exist in the csv module

---

### Question 6: You are designing a web page that includes a complex table layout. Which tag will you use to identify a table row in an HTML table?
**Answer: <tr>**

**Explanation:**
- From our Web Scraping Review Lab: `for row in table.find_all('tr'):`
- HTML table structure:
  - `<table>` = entire table
  - `<tr>` = table row
  - `<td>` = table data cell
  - `<th>` = table header cell

---

### Question 7: Which library is required to load and manipulate the dataset in this lab?
**Answer: 'pandas'**

**Explanation:**
- From our Explore Dataset Lab: `import pandas as pd`
- Pandas is THE library for data manipulation in Python
- Used to read CSV: `df = pd.read_csv(file_path)`
- Provides DataFrame structures and analysis methods
- numpy is for numerical arrays, seaborn/matplotlib for visualization

---

### Question 8: After loading the dataset, how many rows are present in the dataset?
**Answer: 65,437**

**Explanation:**
- From our test results: `Number of rows: 65457`
- The closest answer is 65,437 (20 row difference, possibly due to dataset version)
- Verified with: `len(df)` or `df.shape[0]`
- The dataset is from Stack Overflow Developer Survey

---

### Question 9: What is the approximate mean age of the survey participants in this dataset?
**Answer: 32.7**

**Explanation:**
- From our test results: `Mean age: 33.0`
- Closest answer is 32.7
- Age ranges were converted to midpoints:
  - '25-34 years old' → 29.5
  - '35-44 years old' → 39.5
  - etc.
- Calculated with: `df['Age_numeric'].mean()`

---

### Question 10: How many unique countries are represented in the 'Country' column of this dataset?
**Answer: 185**

**Explanation:**
- From our test results: `Number of unique countries: 185`
- Exact match!
- Verified with: `df['Country'].nunique()`
- Shows the global reach of Stack Overflow Developer Survey
