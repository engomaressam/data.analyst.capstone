## Multiple Choice Questions

### Question 1: What is the primary purpose of creating a dashboard?
**Answer: Visualize and analyze data effectively**

**Explanation:**
- Dashboards are designed to present data in a visual, easily digestible format
- Enable quick insights and data-driven decision making
- Transform raw data into meaningful visualizations
- Our Python implementation demonstrates this with Plotly interactive charts
- Not for storing raw data (databases do that)
- Not for sharing raw datasets (that's data distribution)
- Not primarily for code transformations (that's ETL)

---

### Question 2: What dashboard layout template organizes visualizations in both labs?
**Answer: 2 x 2 rectangle areas**

**Explanation:**
- Both IBM Cognos and Google Looker Studio use 2 x 2 grid layout
- Our Python implementation uses `make_subplots(rows=2, cols=2)`
- Creates 4 panels per dashboard (2 rows Ã— 2 columns)
- Provides balanced, organized visualization layout
- Allows for comparison across 4 key metrics
- Used in all 3 of our dashboards:
  ```python
  fig = make_subplots(rows=2, cols=2, ...)
  ```

---

### Question 3: Why include chart titles and value labels in visualizations?
**Answer: To help viewers understand the chart's purpose and details**

**Explanation:**
- Chart titles provide context about what data is shown
- Value labels give exact numbers for data-driven decisions
- Essential for clarity and interpretation
- Professional dashboards always include these elements
- Our implementation includes:
  ```python
  text=data['Count'],
  textposition='outside',
  ```
- Not just for aesthetics or file size
- Software requirements vary, but good practice is universal

---

### Question 4: Which chart type is most suitable for visualizing trends or distributions in respondent ages?
**Answer: Line chart**

**Explanation:**
- Line charts show trends and changes over ordered categories
- Age groups have natural order (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.)
- Shows progression and patterns clearly
- We also used **Pie chart** for age distribution (shows proportions)
- Stacked bar is for comparing multiple categories
- Word cloud is for word frequency, not numeric trends

---

### Question 5: What is a necessary step before using a dataset in analytics tools?
**Answer: Uploading the dataset as a data asset to the tool**

**Explanation:**
- Must import/upload data before visualization
- In our Python implementation:
  ```python
  df = pd.read_csv('survey_results_updated.csv')
  ```
- Cognos/Looker require uploading as data asset
- Not about copying to tabs or editing in text editor
- Deleting unused rows is optional preprocessing, not necessary

---

### Question 6: Why apply filters to exclude null values in your dashboard?
**Answer: Improve the accuracy of visualizations**

**Explanation:**
- Null values can skew results and create misleading visualizations
- Improves data quality and analysis accuracy
- Our implementation handles this:
  ```python
  series.dropna()  # Remove null values
  ```
- Not primarily about dataset size or loading speed
- About ensuring visualizations represent real, valid data
- Prevents errors in aggregations and calculations

---

### Question 7: Which metric is used in both labs to visualize current technology usage?
**Answer: Top 10 languages used**

**Explanation:**
- `LanguageHaveWorkedWith` is in both Cognos and Looker labs
- Shows current technology adoption
- We implemented this as Panel 1 in Dashboard 1
- Not respondent age (that's demographics)
- Not education levels (that's demographics)
- Not desired platforms (that's future trends)

---

### Question 8: Which chart type displays hierarchical data in PlatformWantToWorkWith?
**Answer: Tree map chart**

**Explanation:**
- Tree map shows hierarchical data with nested rectangles
- Specified for Future Technology Trends dashboard
- Visualizes platforms with size representing frequency
- Our Python implementation uses scatter bubbles as alternative:
  ```python
  mode='markers+text',
  marker=dict(size=..., color=...)
  ```
- Hierarchy bubble is for web frameworks, not platforms
- Bar chart is for languages/databases
- Word cloud is for current platforms

---

### Question 9: What chart type is most suitable for visualizing respondent distribution by gender?
**Answer: Pie chart**

**Explanation:**
- Pie charts show proportions of a whole
- Perfect for categorical distributions like gender
- Shows percentage of each category
- We used pie chart for Age distribution in Demographics
- Scatter bubble is for relationships
- Stacked column for comparisons
- Line chart for trends

---

### Question 10: What must students submit to meet grading requirements?
**Answer: A GitHub link to the PDF export of the dashboard**

**Explanation:**
- Assignment requires permanent link to dashboard
- For Cognos: export to PDF, then share link
- For Looker: similar export process
- Our Python implementation creates:
  - PDF presentation: `Dashboard_Presentation.pdf`
  - HTML dashboard: `Interactive_Dashboard.html`
  - PNG images for all dashboards
- Not just screenshots in Word doc
- Not the original dataset
- Not raw CSV files
