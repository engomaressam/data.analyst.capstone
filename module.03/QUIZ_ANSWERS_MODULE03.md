# Module 03 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Quiz Answers

## Based on completed notebooks and EDA techniques

---

### Question 1: Which function helps identify missing values in each column of a DataFrame?
**Answer: df.isnull().sum()**

**Explanation:**
- `df.isnull()` returns a boolean DataFrame showing True for missing values
- `.sum()` counts the True values (missing) for each column
- Used in all our EDA notebooks to identify missing data
- `df.describe()` shows statistics, not missing values
- `df.info()` shows data types and non-null counts but doesn't sum missing values
- `df.missing_values()` doesn't exist in pandas

---

### Question 2: Which of the following commands is used to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable?
**Answer: sns.countplot(data=df, x='column')**

**Explanation:**
- `sns.countplot()` creates bar charts for categorical data showing frequency counts
- Used in our JobSat and Employment visualization tasks
- `sns.lineplot()` is for continuous data trends
- `sns.scatterplot()` is for relationships between two numerical variables
- `sns.histplot()` is primarily for numerical distributions, not categorical

---

### Question 3: Which pandas function can you use to compute cross-tabulations?
**Answer: pd.crosstab()**

**Explanation:**
- `pd.crosstab()` creates cross-tabulation tables showing frequency distribution
- Used in our Employment vs EdLevel analysis
- Example: `pd.crosstab(df['Employment'], df['EdLevel'])`
- `pd.merge()` combines DataFrames
- `pd.groupby()` groups data for aggregation
- `pd.correlation()` doesn't exist (it's `df.corr()`)

---

### Question 4: What is the median ConvertedCompYearly of respondents in the dataset?
**Answer: 65,000**

**Explanation:**
- From our data wrangling in Module 02, we found median compensation: $65,000
- This was verified when filtering for full-time employees
- Median is more robust than mean for skewed salary data
- This value is consistent across our analysis

---

### Question 5: Which method is used to detect outliers by calculating the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles?
**Answer: Interquartile Range (IQR)**

**Explanation:**
- IQR = Q3 - Q1 (75th percentile - 25th percentile)
- Outliers are defined as values beyond Q1 - 1.5*IQR or Q3 + 1.5*IQR
- Used extensively in our Lab 12 (Finding Outliers)
- More robust than standard deviation for non-normal distributions
- Standard deviation and Z-score use mean and std, not percentiles
- Mean absolute deviation is different from IQR

---

### Question 6: Which pandas function can you use to calculate the skewness of a data column?
**Answer: df.skew()**

**Explanation:**
- `df.skew()` or `df['column'].skew()` calculates skewness
- Skewness measures asymmetry of the distribution
- Positive skew: tail on right (salary data typically has this)
- Used in our log transformation task to reduce skewness
- `df.describe()` shows statistics but not skewness
- `df.corr()` calculates correlations
- `df.var()` calculates variance

---

### Question 7: What is the best practice for handling extreme outliers in a dataset when analyzing average compensation?
**Answer: Remove the outliers to prevent skewing the analysis**

**Explanation:**
- Extreme outliers can significantly skew mean and other statistics
- Removing outliers (using IQR method) provides more representative analysis
- We implemented this in Lab 12 and Lab 13
- Replacement with NaN loses information unnecessarily
- Ignoring outliers leads to inaccurate conclusions
- Setting to 1.5 IQR is the identification threshold, not the handling method

---

### Question 8: How would you identify the median ConvertedCompYearly for full-time employees in the dataset?
**Answer: By filtering the dataset for full-time employees and calculating the median**

**Explanation:**
- Correct approach: `df[df['Employment'] == 'Employed, full-time']['ConvertedCompYearly'].median()`
- Implemented in Lab 13, Step 4
- Filtering ensures we only analyze full-time employee salaries
- Calculating mean of all values doesn't isolate full-time employees
- Mode is for most common value, not central tendency
- Removing outliers first is optional but filtering is essential

---

### Question 9: What does the absence of correlation between Age and WorkExp indicate?
**Answer: Age has no impact on work experience in the dataset**

**Explanation:**
- Weak or no correlation (close to 0) means variables don't have a linear relationship
- In our correlation analysis, if Age and WorkExp aren't correlated, age doesn't predict work experience
- This could indicate career changers or diverse entry points
- "Unrelated to dataset" is incorrect - they're both in the dataset
- "As age increases, experience decreases" would be negative correlation
- "Strong relationship but not perfect" would be correlation close to ±1

---

### Question 10: What is the purpose of removing outliers from the ConvertedCompYearly column before analyzing salary trends?
**Answer: Focus on more common salary values and reduce skewness**

**Explanation:**
- Outlier removal helps focus analysis on typical compensation ranges
- Reduces skewness in the distribution
- Makes mean and other statistics more representative
- Implemented in our Lab 12 and Lab 13
- Doesn't increase median (median is already robust to outliers)
- Doesn't ensure uniqueness (that's duplicate removal)
- Size reduction is a side effect, not the purpose
