# Module 04 - Data Visualization - Quiz Answers

## Based on completed notebooks and visualization techniques

---

### Question 1: Which visualization method is most suitable for displaying the distribution of YearsCodePro among respondents?
**Answer: Histogram**

**Explanation:**
- Histograms show the distribution of a single continuous variable
- Perfect for visualizing how YearsCodePro is distributed across respondents
- Shows frequency of different experience levels
- Used in our Lab 14 for CompTotal and YearsCodePro distributions
- Bubble plot shows relationships between 3 variables
- Pie chart is for categorical proportions
- Line chart is for trends over time

---

### Question 2: Which of the following variable is most appropriate for examining the distribution of work arrangement preferences?
**Answer: RemoteWork**

**Explanation:**
- `RemoteWork` column contains work arrangement preferences
- Shows categories like "Full remote", "Hybrid", "In-office"
- Perfect for analyzing work preference distribution
- Used in our visualization labs
- `CompTotal` is compensation, not work arrangement
- Upper boundary and whisker are box plot elements, not variables
- These are technical terms, not data columns

---

### Question 3: Which of the following visualization is ideal for analyzing the composition of desired databases among respondents?
**Answer: Histogram**

**Explanation:**
- Histogram (or bar chart) shows frequency/count of categories
- Perfect for showing which databases are most desired
- We used this in Lab 14 for Top 5 DatabaseWantToWorkWith
- Shows composition by frequency
- Bubble plot is for 3-variable relationships
- Line chart is for trends over time
- Box plot is for distribution and outliers

---

### Question 4: Which column combination is most suitable for creating a bubble plot to analyze job satisfaction and compensation, with age as the bubble size?
**Answer: ConvertedCompYearly and JobSatPoints_6**

**Explanation:**
- Bubble plots need 3 variables: X, Y, and size
- X-axis: ConvertedCompYearly (compensation)
- Y-axis: JobSatPoints_6 (job satisfaction)
- Bubble size: Age
- This combination analyzes relationship between satisfaction and compensation
- Used in our bubble plot labs
- Other combinations don't make sense for this analysis

---

### Question 5: Why is it essential to understand data relationships before choosing variables for scatterplots?
**Answer: To choose variables that show meaningful correlations**

**Explanation:**
- Scatter plots visualize relationships between two variables
- Should choose variables that potentially correlate
- Meaningless to plot unrelated variables
- Helps identify trends, patterns, or lack thereof
- Not about data format conversion (already done)
- Not for decoration
- Aesthetics are secondary to meaningful insights

---

### Question 6: For visualizing the top 5 programming languages respondents have experience with, which column is most suitable?
**Answer: LanguageHaveWorkedWith**

**Explanation:**
- `LanguageHaveWorkedWith` contains languages respondents have used
- Perfect for showing experience-based language distribution
- Used in our EDA labs
- `DatabaseWantToWorkWith` is for databases, not languages
- `LanguageAdmired` is about admiration, not experience
- `MainBranch` is about developer role, not languages

---

### Question 7: In the lab, how do you create a stacked chart comparing median job satisfaction for 'JobSatPoints_6' and 'JobSatPoints_7' across different employment statuses?
**Answer: Use '.groupby()' on `Employment` and plot with 'kind='bar', stacked=True'**

**Explanation:**
- `.groupby('Employment')` groups data by employment status
- Calculate medians for each group
- `kind='bar', stacked=True` creates stacked bar chart
- Used in our stacked chart lab
- Scatter plot doesn't create stacked charts
- `.hist()` is for histograms, not grouped comparisons
- `plt.plot()` creates line charts, not stacked bars

---

### Question 8: Which type of data is most suitable for visualization with a line chart?
**Answer: Continuous data over time**

**Explanation:**
- Line charts show trends and changes over time or sequence
- Perfect for continuous data that changes
- Used in Lab for CompTotal trends by age groups
- Shows progression and patterns
- Nominal data (categories) better suited for bar charts
- Categorical data better for bar/pie charts
- Ordinal without order doesn't show progression

---

### Question 9: Where should the age groups typically be placed in a line chart showing median compensation by age group?
**Answer: On the X-axis**

**Explanation:**
- X-axis (horizontal) shows the independent variable (age groups)
- Y-axis (vertical) shows the dependent variable (compensation)
- Standard convention for line charts
- Shows progression from younger to older ages
- Used in our line chart lab
- Y-axis is for the measured value (compensation)
- Legend is for multiple series
- Tooltips are for interactive details

---

### Question 10: What advantage does a grouped bar chart provide over a standard bar chart when comparing median compensation across age groups?
**Answer: It provides a comparison across multiple categories side by side**

**Explanation:**
- Grouped bar charts show multiple series side by side
- Allows easy visual comparison across categories
- Can show multiple metrics (e.g., median, mean) for same categories
- More informative than single category
- Doesn't eliminate legend (legend identifies groups)
- Doesn't combine categories (that's stacked)
- Shows multiple categories, not single
