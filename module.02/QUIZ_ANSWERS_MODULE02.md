# Module 02 - Multiple Choice Quiz Answers

## Based on completed notebooks and practical experience

---

### Question 1: What code would you use to identify the number of duplicate rows in a DataFrame named df?
**Answer: df.duplicated().sum()**

**Explanation:**
- `df.duplicated()` returns a boolean Series indicating duplicate rows
- `.sum()` counts the True values (duplicates)
- Used in all our duplicate detection labs
- Other options don't exist as pandas methods

---

### Question 2: Which code correctly removes duplicates from df based on specific columns, such as ['ResponseId', 'MainBranch']?
**Answer: df.drop_duplicates(subset=['ResponseId', 'MainBranch'])**

**Explanation:**
- The `subset` parameter specifies which columns to consider for duplicate detection
- Used in our Finding Duplicates lab: `df.drop_duplicates(subset=['ResponseId'], keep='first')`
- `columns` parameter doesn't exist in drop_duplicates()
- Without parameters, it checks all columns

---

### Question 3: Which code would you use to identify the columns in a DataFrame named df that have the same values in duplicate rows?
**Answer: df.loc[df.duplicated(keep=False)].nunique()**

**Explanation:**
- `df.duplicated(keep=False)` marks ALL duplicate rows (not just subsequent ones)
- `df.loc[...]` selects those duplicate rows
- `.nunique()` counts unique values per column
- Columns with fewer unique values have more identical values in duplicates
- Default axis=0 counts unique values per column

---

### Question 4: After identifying duplicates, which statement accurately verifies if they were successfully removed?
**Answer: Re-running df.duplicated().sum() and ensuring it equals zero**

**Explanation:**
- `df.duplicated().sum()` counts remaining duplicate rows
- Zero means all duplicates removed
- Used in our labs: `print(f"Remaining duplicates: {df.duplicated().sum()}")`
- `df.drop_duplicates()` returns a new DataFrame, doesn't verify in-place
- `df.isnull().sum()` checks missing values, not duplicates
- `df.dropna()` is for missing values, not duplicates

---

### Question 5: Which of the following is the most appropriate method to replace missing values in a column with the column's most frequent value?
**Answer: df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mode()[0])**

**Explanation:**
- `df['column'].mode()[0]` gets the most frequent value (mode)
- `.fillna()` replaces NaN values
- Used in our imputation labs for categorical columns (Employment, RemoteWork)
- `.fillna(0)` uses a fixed value, not the mode
- `.fillna(df['column'].mean())` uses average, not most frequent

---

### Question 6: What is the purpose of using df.describe(include='all') on a DataFrame?
**Answer: Display summary statistics for all columns, including categorical data**

**Explanation:**
- `df.describe()` without parameters shows only numerical columns
- `include='all'` includes categorical columns too
- Shows count, unique values, top value, frequency for categorical
- Used in our exploratory data analysis tasks
- Doesn't identify or remove missing/duplicate values

---

### Question 7: What is the most appropriate method to fill missing values with the most frequent value in a specific column?
**Answer: df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mode()[0])**

**Explanation:**
- Same as Question 5
- `.mode()[0]` gets the most frequent value
- `.fillna()` replaces NaN with that value
- Used for categorical data imputation
- The "Independent contractor" option is a data value, not a method

---

### Question 8: Which command should you use to replace all NaN values in the column 'RemoteWork' with a specific value?
**Answer: df['RemoteWork'].fillna('value', inplace=True)**

**Explanation:**
- `.fillna('value', inplace=True)` replaces NaN with 'value' and modifies the DataFrame
- Used in our RemoteWork imputation task
- `df.mean()` doesn't work on categorical columns
- `.dropna()` removes rows instead of replacing
- `.replace()` needs different syntax

---

### Question 9: What is the function of the MinMaxScaler when applied to a column of data?
**Answer: Scales data to be between 0 and 1**

**Explanation:**
- Min-Max Scaling: `(x - min) / (max - min)`
- Transforms data to [0, 1] range
- Used in our normalization lab for ConvertedCompYearly
- Formula: `df['col_normalized'] = (df['col'] - df['col'].min()) / (df['col'].max() - df['col'].min())`
- Doesn't drop duplicates, replace NaN, or standardize to mean=0

---

### Question 10: Which function provides summary statistics, including mean and count, for a numeric column in a DataFrame?
**Answer: df.describe()**

**Explanation:**
- `df.describe()` returns count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max
- Used in all our exploratory analysis tasks
- Perfect for understanding numerical data distribution
- `.fillna()`, `.dropna()`, `.isnull()` are for missing value handling, not statistics
